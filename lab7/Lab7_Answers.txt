		    Lab 7 - Rotary Encoders and Interrupts

Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.


1. (1 point) Briefly explain why it is undesirable to read the two encoder
input signals with two separate PINC statements.

If we had two PINC statements, it would register situations for which a and b are being checked for incorrect values. 

2. (1 point) Briefly explain why updating the LCD display in your ISR could
lead to undesirable behavior for this lab.


This would cause a lag to occur as a change in the rotary will not cause the interrupt function to trigger again. The LCD display would miss numbers when the count changes.
