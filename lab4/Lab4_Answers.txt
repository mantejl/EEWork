			 Lab 4 - Using the LCD Display

Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.

1. (2 points) We want you to feel comfortable reading documentation to
understand the operation of a device.  To that end, open the ATmega328P
manufacturer's datasheet linked on our website from the Tools and Links Page.
The question below is related to the material in Section 14.2 on page 85.

Billy Bruin has read Section 14.2 on page 85 of the ATmega328P datasheet and
says that he now knows an easy way to "toggle" the E bit (flipping it to its
opposite value) to generate the E pulse in the lcd_writenibble() function by
using this code.

    PINB |= (1 << PB1)     // Toggle E bit from 0 to 1
    PORTB |= (1 << PB1);   // Delay to make the E pulse longer
    PINB |= (1 << PB1)     // Toggle E bit from 1 to 0

Tammy Trojan has read the same section of the datasheet, and studied Figure
14-2 on page 85, and she says that while Billy's method may work for the
lcd_writenibble() function in Lab 4, it can cause problems when used in other
situations.  She recommends using this code.

    PINB = (1 << PB1)      // Toggle E bit from 0 to 1
    PORTB |= (1 << PB1);   // Delay to make the E pulse longer
    PINB = (1 << PB1)      // Toggle E bit from 1 to 0

Study Section 14.2 and then explain what the problem is with Billy's method,
and why Tammy's is the correct way to do it.

Tammy's way we would only change one specific bit, but with Billy's method we flip bits that we are not supposed to do. Billy's method would change a lot of the bits, 



2. (1 point) Suppose we need to perform 3 concurrent tasks intermittently: Task
A every 20 ms, Task B every 15 ms, and Task C every 40 ms. What delay should be
used on each iteration of the main loop?
 
 120ms
