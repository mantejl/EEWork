Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.

1. (2 points) Suppose we relocated the three buttons from group B, bits 5-3 to
group D, bits 5-3, noting that the LED is still attached to group D, bit
2. Assuming appropriate DDRD values, consider the following method of turning
on the LED.

    PORTD = 0x04; // turn on the LED

Explain the problem with this approach and, in particular, what would stop
working after the execution of that line of code.

- The LED would stop working because the buttons have relocated so the circuit wouldn't be fully connected. 






2. (2 points) Briefly explain why the delay between the press of the 'C' button
and the start of the LED on/off sequence varied when you took multiple=
measurements?  Think about the timing of how software executes.


- We had the delay statements that delayed the press and the LED which occurred when we were taking multiple measurements.
