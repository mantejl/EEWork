Lab 5 - Combination Lock

Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.

1. (2 points) To ensure a date appears in the format: MM/DD, what snprintf()
formatting string could be used to ensure dates like 6/9 are generated in a
character buffer as 06/09.

	char buf[17];
	int m = 6; d = 9;
	snprintf(buf, 17, /* you write the format string */, m, d);

- snprintf(buf, 17,"%02d/%02d",m,d);


2. (1 point) Bobby Bruin wants to add a secret code to the lock where the user
can go directly from state S0 to the unlocked state S5 by pressing both buttons
at the same time.  Tammy Trojan, thinking about the execution speed of the
processor, says this can't be done, at least not reliably.  What is her reason
for thinking so?

The speed of the processor is so high, and as a result, it is almost impossible for a human to click both buttons at literally the exact same time. Hence, that is the reasoning behind Tammy's thinking.
